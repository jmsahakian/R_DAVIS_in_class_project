# This is a big header

## This is a smaller header

This is just some regular text.  Or some **bold** text.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE) 

#code is knitted from top to bottom - should run as if your code was part of one script

```


```{r}
#cmd+option+i adds a code chunk

library(tidyverse)
```

Loaded tidyverse, now we'll examine data.

```{r}
summary(storms)
str(storms)
``` 

Let's make a plot!

```{r}
storms %>% 
  ggplot (aes(x = as.factor(month), y = pressure, color = wind)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5)

```
